# Dev Standards

What does it mean to "know" Ruby? Rails? JavaScript?

The purpose of this tool is to help map the essential skills it takes to be proficient in these technologys. The initial goal is to support learners in [Hungry Academy](http://hungryacademy.com), but the hope is that they become a helpful resource to the community at large.
